<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Colin McClintic and I am a senior computer engineering major here at Lewis. In my major courses, I have learned</p>
<p>both the hardware and software side of computers. While I always enjoy the hands-on work that I do with building circuits and</p>
<p>exploring hardware systems, programming is something I have grown a great passion for and wish to start a career in. I believe my</p>
<p>ability to communicate and problem-solve makes coding simpler and more enjoyable for me.</p>
<p>I have attended Lewis University for about three and a half years and am apart of the men's volleyball team. I have also worked</p>
<p>on campus at the service desk since the summer leading up to my sophomore year. Being apart of the volleyball team here on campus</p>
<p>has taught me how to effectively communicate with a team as well as how to manage high pressure situations. These skills actually</p>
<p>come in handy often when working on school projects because communication is vital in successful group projects, and working with</p>
<p>deadlines can be quite stressful. My time working in the service desk at the Office of Technology furthered my problem-solving and</p>
<p>communication skills, because assisting people requires a balance of figuring things out yourself and leaning on the knowledge of others.</p>
<br>
<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<ul>
	<li>How to use programming to create realistic and useful applications</li>
	<li>How to run the front end and back end of a web application on different platforms</li>
	<li>How to monitor web applications and manage databases</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p>Basketball is my favorite hobby because it is something that I always enjoy watching and spend a lot of time keeping up with.</p>
<p>I started watching basketball when Derrick Rose became the youngest MVP ever. He started my love for basketball because his</p>
<p>explosiveness was something I had never seen before, and it was incredibly fun to watch. It was also the raw passion and emotion</p>
<p>that would come out during the games that made being a Bulls fan so enjoyable. Derrick Rose could will the Bulls to beat any team</p>
<p>which gave hope to all of the fans that hard work can beat talent. There are countless NBA stories that have inspired the world.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant is a prime example of extending influence past the game of basketball. Kobe's will and determination showed people</p>
<p>what it looks like to put maximum effort into your goals in order to achieve them.</p>
<br>
<h2>Greatest Innovation</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank">Internet</a> - provided wireless connection to an endless source of information</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone">Mobile Phone</a> - allowed people to take the internet anywhere they wanted</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a> - gives computer a structure to follow rather than coding individual tasks</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>A fun fact about myself is I am 6'11" and am afraid of heights.</p>
